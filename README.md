## Overview  
<hr>  
Basic waiting line queueing system

## Technologies
* Excell
* Python
* R



# Installations
* R
    1.  Ensure R is installed
    1.  Ensure R is added to the Path (PC):  `C:/Program Files/R/<version>/bin`
    1.  Open Gitbash and type `r` to open the r terminal
    1.  Install package:  `install.packages('quequecomputer')`
    1.  Select download region from popup
    1.  Check that package is now available:  `libary('quequecomputer')` - no errors should occur
    1.  Close terminal and open new Gitbash and install `pip install rpy2` into your environment

```Note:  rpy2 requires R 4.0+ and Python 3.7+ and older version of Visual Studio Build Tool (like 2019) can cause install errors.  I needed to uninstall the older tool and reinstall the most recent version.  Visual Studio Build Tools 2022 works fine with R 4.2 and Python 3.10 for my setup```
